I am a **PhD Candidate** in the [Department of Demography](https://hcap.utsa.edu/demography/) at the [University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA)](https://www.utsa.edu/).

I am also a **Graduate Research Assistant** in the TxDOT project at the [Institute for Demographic and Socioeconomic Research (IDSER)](https://idser.utsa.edu/) at UTSA.

My research interests are:

      - Mortality 
      - Aging 
      - Race and Ethnicity
      - Health Disparities 
      - Mental Health 
      - Causal inference.

I earned my MA in Sociology in 2012 from the McMaster University in Hamilton, ON, Canada. I am expecting to finish my dissertation in Spring 2021. I am looking for a postdoctoral position to further my career in academia.
